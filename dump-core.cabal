synopsis:            A plug-in for rendering GHC core
description:         This is a GHC plugin that renders the Core generated by
                     GHC into JSON and also HTML, for easy inspection.
                     The JSON is machine readable so it could be used by
                     other tools, although at present the format is not
                     documented and unstable.
